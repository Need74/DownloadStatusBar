# DownloadStatusBar

## Localization
To add translations for a new language copy [\_locales/en_CA/messages.json](_locales/en_CA/messages.json) to a new folder with the proper language code inside [\_locales](_locales) then follow [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) to create a pull request.

Only the "message" values need to be translated, the "description" is just to give some context to translators.
